# Swamp-Land
An old apple2 AppleSoft BASIC text based game I made in the style of Beagle Bros. It was the first piece of code I was really proud to have written, I wrote it over a weekend while my parents were away camping probably around 1980.

Note: the code makes heavy use of control characters in the text strings so it will be hard to copy and paste into an emulator but I have included the binary BASIC file that can be copied to a disk and then run from there.
