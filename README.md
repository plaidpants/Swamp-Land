# Swamp-Land
An old apple2 AppleSoft BASIC text based game I made in the style of Beagle Bros

Note: the code makes heavy use of control characters in the text strings so it will be hard to copy and paste into an emulator but I have included the binary BASIC file that can be copied to a disk and then run from there.
